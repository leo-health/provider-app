Your continued use of or access to the Website or Leo Health Services following the posting of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.  Leo Health may also, in the future, offer new Leo Health Services and/or features through the Website (including, the release of new tools and resources).  Such new features and/or Leo Health Services shall be subject to these Terms of Service.</p>

            <h3>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>These Terms of Service, and your relationship with Leo Health under these Terms of Service, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict or choice of law provisions.</p>
            <p>If a dispute arises between you and the Leo Health Parties, you agree to work in good faith to quickly and amicably resolve the dispute.  All disputes, claims, or controversies (each a “Claim”) arising under or relating to these Terms of Service, the Website, or the Leo Health Services that cannot be resolved informally, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described herein.</p>
            <p>Any dispute arising under or related to these Terms of Service, the Website, or the Leo Health Services (including the arbitrability of such a dispute and the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, termination, or breach thereof) shall be finally settled by binding arbitration by a single arbitrator in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), with the arbitration to be commenced no later than one (1) year after such Claim accrues (in absence of which it shall be deemed forever waived).  A judgment upon an arbitrator's award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that there shall be no class action arbitration related to these Terms of Service, the Website, or the Leo Health Services.  All parties shall bear their own expenses, except that the parties shall equally share the expenses of the arbitrator (except for the required non-refundable filing fees which shall be paid solely by the party asserting the related Claim).  The above obligations to arbitrate shall not prevent a party from seeking a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, specific performance or other procedures in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain interim relief when deemed necessary by such court to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable injury pending resolution by arbitration of the actual dispute.</p>
            <p>Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for arbitration or any other legal action or proceeding in any way related to the Website, the Leo Health Services, or these Terms of Service shall be in Manhattan, New York.  Any matter brought before a court shall be brought solely in the state or federal courts located in Manhattan, New York.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a dispute in which Leo Health alleges that you have violated any of Leo Health's intellectual property rights, the foregoing arbitration obligations shall not apply, and Leo Health shall have the right to proceed against you in any manner warranted under law.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with the Leo Health Parties, arising out of or relating to your use of the Website, the Leo Health Services, or these Terms of Service:</p>

            <p>If any portion of these Terms of Service is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, these Terms of Service as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of these Terms of Service that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from these Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>You agree that if Leo Health does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms of Service (or which Leo Health has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Leo Health's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Leo Health.</p>
            <p>All covenants, terms and conditions, representations and warranties which by their nature should survive that termination of these Terms of Service shall survive your acceptance of these Terms of Service and the termination of these Terms of Service (e.g., limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, dispute resolution, and indemnification), regardless of the cause of such termination.</p>
            <p>These Terms of Service, along with the <a href="/privacy">Leo Health Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and Terms of Service between Leo Health and you regarding the Website, Leo Health Services and Content, and supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or terms of service between Leo Health and you regarding the Website and the Leo Health Services.</p>
